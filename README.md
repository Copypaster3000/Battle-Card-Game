# Battle Card Game

This project is a two-player battle card game written in C++. Each player is dealt three types of cards (attack, defense, heal) and must strategically select cards each round to reduce their opponentâ€™s health to zero. The game leverages custom data structures, operator overloading, and object-oriented programming to provide an engaging card-based battle system.

## Features
- Object-Oriented Design: The game is built using a hierarchy of classes, including AttackCard, DefenseCard, and HealCard, all derived from a base Card class. This modular design allows for the easy addition of new card types.
- Circular Linked List (CLL) and Linear Linked List (LLL): The game uses a Circular Linked List to manage defense cards and a Linear Linked List to manage attack cards, providing efficient card management. Additionally, the Standard Template Library (STL) vector is used to manage heal cards, allowing dynamic resizing and efficient access.
- Dynamic Card Stats: Cards are created with randomized stats within defined ranges. Each game the cards are different making for a new and unpredictable game each time.
